| “Dangerous strict equality” on sentinel timestamp     | StarforgeStaking.\_pendingSinceLast: `last == 0`              | Accept (project) | `last==0` is an initialization sentinel, not a time comparison on `block.timestamp`. No correctness risk; saves a boolean slot. Covered by tests. |
| “Timestamp comparisons” (>, >=) for accrual/cooldowns | Staking: `_pendingSinceLast`, `claimRewards`, `setBaseApyBps` | Accept (project) | Time-based accrual requires timestamp math. Cooldown/runway checks are intentional safety rails. Tested.                                          |
| “Timestamp comparisons” in vesting                    | TreasuryVesting: `vestedAmount`, `claimVestedTokens`          | Accept (project) | Linear vesting is time-based by design; monotonic and upper-bounded by allocation. Tests cover rounding and “exact remainder.”                    |
| Equality to zero to check schedule existence          | TreasuryVesting.setAllocation: `totalAmount == 0`             | Accept (project) | Sentinel for “no schedule yet.” Prevents overwrite. Safer and cheaper than an extra boolean.                                                      |
| Reserve bound check                                   | TreasuryVesting.recoverExcessSFT: `amount <= excess`          | Accept (project) | Ensures escrow+SRV cannot be drained. Tested.                                                                                                     |
